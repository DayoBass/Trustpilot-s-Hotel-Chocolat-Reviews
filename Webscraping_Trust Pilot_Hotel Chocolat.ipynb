Upon arrival was a beautiful copper coloured Velvetiser and a box of 10 50% milky hot chocolate mixes. I couldn’t wait to try it, I was in choccy heaven, I also had some dunking biscuits which were to die for. I have also signed up for a monthly box of drinking choc to be sent, so I don’t even have to leave home to get my choccy fix.  So well done Hotel Chocolat you’ve made this lady very happy.\n",

I specifically wished to purchase particular items but find them no longer available. Luxury biscuits and certain fruit flavoured batons being two examples. This is on top of the disappointment of the new version of 'Tasting' Club' which now sends the same content monthly (so I have cancelled 3 subscriptions from them) and the ending of 'Build-a'box' which was superb. I only hope that in the rush to accommodate new customers, we 'old' customers are not the only ones finding it hard to find our favourites any longer. Please don't forget us Hotel Chocolat!\n",

Although Hotel Chocolat is a little more expensive than other high street brands, the quality difference is definitely worth it. After trying tons of products, not one has left me disappointed and I always seem to want to go back for more! Customer service is outstanding, the best I’ve experienced in a long time actually. Staff at my local store are very friendly and if you return multiple times, actually get to know you as a customer and your preferences. Store is always very clean and presented very neatly, with a large selection of products available. Customer service over the phone is also good, helpful advisors and online orders are easy and efficient. VIPME is very beneficial and rewards you well for loyalty, love the 20% off in the cafe, became my frequent cafe whenever I’m in town!

Company name and full address. Days later I got an e-mail from Hotel Chocolate confirming they had posted the parcel to: and then set out half the address without the recipients name or the company name. I queued for ages in their telephone system and eventually got through to someone who kept repeating the address to me seemingly not understanding that the name and company were important, eventually the information was confirmed correctly and I left them to it. A few days later I got another email from them saying that there was no one home, the parcel couldn't be delivered and I had to phone Royal Mail to rearrange delivery. Again I endured the wait on Hotel Chocolate phone queue and eventually got through. I pointed out that the recipient address was a main office of an estate agency with 12 people working there and couldn't possibly have been closed.I told them that I expected them to liase with Royal Mail to arrange redelivery. I had arranged delivery via persons unknown and paid for that delivery to Hotel Chocolate and it was their responsibility to ensure delivery. A frustrating and argumentative conversation ensued, made worse by the fact that I was standing in a school playground to pick up my grandson, eventually the operator said he hd contacted his boss and they couldn't help. I refused to accept that and was finally told that I would be contacted in half an hour by a senior executive from their head office. I was surprised when that actually happened and I was told they would resend a second parcel for next day delivery and would refund my postage. This was carried out correctly. There was no need for them to be so difficult in fixing their problem which eventually they did.The chocolates I am told were wonderful as usual but a notice with regret that your boxes are being filled with more and more of your chocolate batons which I find quite tasteless and boring and wouldn't willingly include at all.\", 'Date': '10 February 2023', 'Reply': 'We are sorry to hear of your experience Keith.

Unfortunately it seems that the merchant has taken the decision to decline this claim, and due to this we have not received any cashback to pay over to you or to add to your account.The reason that we have received to support this decision states:\"NON-COMMISSIONABLE\"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This aside, when the Velvetiser arrived, inside the box, there was info on how to claim the free dunking biscuits pack online.I redeemed the voucher, and went into the HC store to collect the pack. When I got home, I saw that the pack was months out of date!In the circumstances, I will never ever recommend Hotel Chocolat to anyone. Their promotional selling tactics are a fraud, and the stores give out of date goods as their  \\'freebie\\' incentive.I regret buying the machine on point of principle, but for sure, I\\'ll never touch them again, and only use the velvetiser with chocolate products purchased anywhere but there.For the sake of £2.65 (the inedible \\'freebie\\' was bad enough) Hotel Chocolat have lost a customer, for good.You have gone into my bin, same as the months out of date biscuits you gave me as a so-called customer \"thank you\" 😫', 'Date': '03 February 2023', 'Reply': 'Hi there Claire, we are terribly sorry to hear about this and for the Dunking Biscuits.

There is a range of different flavoured hot chocolate ranges including seasonal ones  like mince pie and salted clemantine and my favourite Black Forest Gautuax (heavenly) and the usual plain chocolate - I've tried quite a few since getting this velvetise and there is still more.

Bought a Velvetiser mid Nov as an Xmas gift. This turned out to be a duplicate gift, but I'd asked the question upon purchase if the usual 30 day refund terms would be extended based on Xmas as most places do, and was told yes a refund would be able to be arranged if required until end of Jan. Contacted them the day after boxing day to arrange the return, but got no replies to my email. Contacted them again on 3rd Jan which was the earliest I could to prompt a reply. Took 3 days to get a reply, at which point I was told I could only return in exchange for gift vouchers to be used in the future, not a refund. Emailed back to say this is not what I'd been told prior to purchase, and all communication from their side has now ceased. First and last time I'll ever purchase from them.... Avoid at all costs! How they get the prestigious name they appear to have is beyond me 😖Update 28/1/23 - Hotel Chocolat have now arranged the return/refund of the velvetiser, but only after reading this negative review. According to them I was misinformed about only being able to be given gift vouchers, which they apologised about and they said they did send another email to me offering a refund, which appears to have gone astray. Not quite sure if I believe them, as they didn't appear to be able to provide a copy of that email, but either way I've now got the outcome that should have happened initially. Should never have come to this, but will have to give them the benefit of the doubt I guess, so I've changed the review from just 1 star to 3 stars as at least they paid attention to the negative review and investigated further.

You can get a subscription of the flakes so you don't have to worry about running out. The subscription is really easy to change if you want to try a new flavour.

A high minus score if it existed would be more appropriate.This is a pestilent reprehensible firm, and should be reported to trading standards.During December I was in Islington, and visited Hotel Chocolat store there. The two assistants in the shop were hell bent on defrauding me. Each Item I put in the basket and took to the till, was wrongly priced in favour of the business. Eventually I ran out of patience and walked out of the shop without purchasing anything.I reported this incident to the firm\\'s Customer Services, that took no notice whatever of my complaint.Instead I put two orders online in December, the items ordered, that were not in the sale, but were priced as usual, were all short dated. An example a dark chocolate marzipan selector [£4.50; 3 for £12] had a date expiring end of January 23. There were other such items I had already gifted to friends and family without checking the date. I should have returned the order.Customer services are beyond the pale. The staff are totally untrained, and the firm has no complaints policy whatever. Shortly after the above order I sent a friend of mine some dark chocolate shortbread biscuits that were in the end of season sale, priced at £18 for 18 shortbreads. Normal price £25 for 18. I was told on the phone [the order could not be placed online. That website has now been dysfunctional for as long as I traded with Hotel Chocolat - some 2 to 3 years] The wretched business will not do anything about it. They are so proud of their products they don\\'t even need customers. My friend received the biscuits loose, packed in a cardboard posting box, marked \\'End of season sale box\\', Lot Number 22354, best before end 03/2023. I asked the agent on the phone how they are packed, and was told they are in a metal box like their so called \"Biscuits of the Gods\". I do know the product, having received a Christmas gift of those just before Christmas 2022. They are dated on the box best before end 01/2023. In fact the pestilent firm is in the habit of palming of aged, disabled, and vulnerable customers with their inferior products. \"Biscuits of the Gods\" will set you off £27 for 18, unless they went up due to inflation, and if they are in stock.Always a loyal customer, I ordered a box of the Dark Chocolate End of Season shortbreads for myself, and discovered how they are sold as presents. These are loose biscuits the Hotel Chocolat shops have at their tills, for customers in need of sustenance when they are shopping, sold at £1.50, or £1.75 each [individual plastic wrapped]. Presumably the remainder is a bargain at £1.00 each. Not forgetting that Hotel Chocolat will charge you £4.95 for standard delivery - allow up to 10 working days, by RM. RM asks for signature, if you miss delivery be prepared to collect at your local sorting office, opened now during strike 08 - 10 am during work days only.I complained again. Totally untrained agent unfazed by my experience refused to deal with the complaint.', 'Date': '11 January 2023', 'Reply': 'Hi Kornelia, thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

The 2nd Velvetiser became faulty but I went slightly over the 12 months which meant I was out of warranty. I had only used the Velvetiser for about 2 months as I only drink hot chocolate during the colder months. But I expected this machine to be tested and meant to be used everyday and be hard wearing. I took great care to ensure my machine was pristine. Sadly Hotel Chocolat refused to replace my item again or refund me. But they offered me to rebuy for half price.

So indulgent and luxurious and perfect for a gift or as a treat for yourself. Obviously this is personal choice but they have a very limited selection of coconut based products, I think there’s only one which is the 6 pack of coconut truffles, which, out of an entire selection in a chocolate shop I think is rather bizarre. The delivery is quick, secure and uncomplicated. If you sign up for the VIP rewards then you receive a £5 voucher to spend on your birthday which I think is a great touch. I purchased the Velvetiser which I do think is great, so easy to use and clean rather than heating milk in a pan, however I find all the hot chocolate selections are a tad bitter for me, even the milky 50% one, again though this is just personal preference.

They didn\\'t allow it on their website which says all you need to know about them. I bring you to their \\'100% happiness guarantee\\'; it\\'s a lie. I am now posting exactly the same review here, on my social media accounts, on my NHS work notice board (where I work), the library and other places. Policing people\\'s reviews is the snakes that run this company.Hi Hotel Chocolat,It is upsetting to write this. After researching the velvetiser for a few weeks, and reading almost but almost wow\\'ing unreal reviews, I was thoroughly underwhelmed by mine. The product is more of a phenomenal marketing exercise than a stand alone great product. Yes I know the vast number of reviews are ecstatic, but then againpeople are ecstatic about watching QVC all day long.I really do not know what to say without sounding too rude, but it simply is not very good at what is meant to be very good at. The drink product is neither frothy or luxurious (a word your website is rampant with), and nowhere near decadent. My first warning bell was the use of the term barista grade. This means nothing. I have tried many hot chocolates around the world, the barista grade ones are usually the worst, average at best. The ones made by grannies in a lovely apron, just before bed, are the best. I am sure Hotel Chocolat has a firm fan base (we should note here so do the Kardashians) and loyal staff so I do not wish to provoke any hostile emotions from my email.I really don\\'t want to, but I wish to return my order. It is an absolute shame. I was absolutely, thoroughly looking forward to the best hot chocolate I had ever tried. That\\'s what you implicitly promised. To me, the product your machine produces is not that, nowhere near that.I have been a hot chocolate drinker ALL my life. As a grown male, I have NEVER tried a cup of tea or coffee. I drank hot chocolate when no one drank hot chocolate. The only other thing I drink is Horlicks (another grandma favourite).Now I want to come onto something which expands on the lack of ethicality. I wrote to the company asking how to return my package. This was their reply:\"Thank you for contacting Hotel Chocolat.You have up to 28 days to return your unwanted items as long as you obtain proof of purchase and they are unopened/unused.Please let me know if I can assist you with anything else.Kind regards,Customer Happiness Team\"I have deleted the name of the customer service responder. Naturally I asked them, I am not allowed to open the box at all, let alone try it? How am I meant to know if it is what I want? It\\'s not cheap for what it is after all. But that\\'s how they trap you, and trap you is what they want to do.The website goes on about 100% happiness guarantee. But there are no specifics. This is an intentional, unethical, omission. There is no time period for returns, there is no method for returns, there is nothing. This is what it says:\\'All of your purchases are covered by our No Excuses Guarantee so if you\\'re not 100% happy with our products or we miss an important delivery date, we guarantee that we\\'ll immediately put it right for you – refunding, replacing or issuing you with a Gift Card as appropriate. In addition, we guarantee to make good any mistakes with honesty and a positive solution that works for you. We never want you to lose faith in Hotel Chocolat and will always go the extra mile so you know how important your custom is to us.\\'I have to say this is puffed up nonsense, in the true to form hotel chocolat way. They do not care about your happiness, nor putting things right. They only care about keeping your money. They are thieves in this regard. They make promises before sales they cannot keep after sales. Many will say this is true about all companies, but I would disagree. Many companies are trying their best to make a shift to more important customer services and management. This is what makes it more shameful that hotel chocolat promises the same but delivers the absolute opposite. A bit like their product.For example over Christmas the vast majority of stores allow extended returns and refunds. Refunds made to the gift recipient. For money. Hotel chocolat? Oh no. They don\\'t do that. If you have received a gift, you can get a gift voucher for hotel chocolat. So that\\'s basically £100 of gift vouchers (for a unwanted velvetiser) to spend in their shop. Where\\'s that clearly stated in the 100% happiness guarantee? It isn\\'t.Mine was a gift from my uncle. Luckily he can return it, but you should all be aware of that. And the company, if they were indeed ethical as they insist, would make sure you were aware of that.A two faced company? Definitely. Thieves? Given the less than mediocre product, absolutely. Here to help you? Not in the least.I just hope no one squanders their money, be promised 100% happy, and get nothing', 'Date': '03 January 2023', 'Reply': 'We are very sorry to hear that you feel this way.

Three were delivered a day late, I can live with that, however, three were delivered three days late and delivered to another completely unrelated company and simply left there, despite having a full company name and address, contact name and phone number.When I rang the help line, I had some punk telling me that I must have given them the wrong address, however, the address provided was my own head office which I know by heart, however, he said he would try to sort it out.On the 20th, I had the \"customer service\" dept call me to say that they had now been delivered to the correct address (which they must have had all along) and sent me a picture with the box sitting on a desk in a deserted reception.I explained that the three people the gifts were intended for had since broken up for Christmas and would not be returning until 3rd January, so the delivery had failed and the gifts were now not fit for purpose.And this is where is gets really poor, the “Customer Care” Woman wanted to haggle overcompensating me and pestered me with phone calls to accept just a postage refund and a small box of chocolates, displaying a complete lack of empathy for my position and despite the following.1.\\tThe gifts arrived at their intended destination 5 days late2.\\tThe recipients will not therefore receive them for Christmas as intended3.\\tI had days of worrying despite telling her I has too ill to deal with such matters4.\\tNo apology for their agents ignoring specific instructions5.

So now I have paid for 2 and I am out of pocket.Why do we have to wait for a refund for an investigation to be carried out as to what happened, which can take an unknown amount of time, so there is no telling when and from what I was told by their customer service department, if I will get a refund.My advice, don't order, pod machines or velvetiser's on line, because if they go missing you will have to wait before you are considered for a refund.

And you can check that with all my closest friends and family. Top company and fantastic chocolate that never fails to disappoint..except one occasion. And this is why I write.We moved from the UK to France and you no longer deliver to France sadly.  It means I have to fill my suitcase every time I am back in London. Last trip, I had preordered the largest chocolatier's table to be waiting for me at my friend's flat.  The trouble is that when I arrived, I realized it didnt fit in my suitcase.  I was flying back home via 2 other cities so had to carry the box separately with me everywhere. It even travelled in business class (albeit the coat rack) while i was in economy. When I finally got it home I didnt tell my wife and just got it out at the next occasion - an important meal with all our friends.  High impact box and the experience of unwrapping it too but when it came to tasting, no one could get the chocolates out of the box.  I had to physically lift the poor plastic packaging up from inside and push them out with my finger.  Super embarrassing and the opposite of what experience I had wanted to create for friends.

Approx 2 minutes later, the chocolate is warm, frothy and tastes delicious. The proportion size is just perfect for a standard mug. Add a little bit of baileys and it adds another dimension to your drink. The only downside is having to swill the machine after each drink made. Just wish I could make more than one drink at a time.

I ordered on 6th December and they were delivered on the 12th. The best before date on them was end December 2022. I would expect a longer date range on a full price product than 2 weeks. I appreciate Hotel Chocolat don’t use preservatives so their date range is shorter than most, but 2 weeks is unacceptable.Customer Services resolved quickly,  by providing me a voucher to purchase more.  They could not send more out to me as could not guarantee the date would not be the same.4 stars as products are great quality, well packaged and customer services was great.

I paid extra for next day delivery.  Got an e-mail with a delivery slot.  That sailed past and at 7pm got a message that someone had tried to deliver but no-one was home.  Complete bull - I didn't leave the house all day and I even sat and worked where I could see the drive for the arrival period and several hours beyond.  Driver didn't even try to deliver.  Then got a message saying it was going to a pick up centre 8 miles away.  Next morning, the tracking update again said it was on it's way.  Hung around again, but late afternoon got another message saying it was being sent to the pick up centre.  Ended up finally getting there several hours later.  Went to pick it up and it took them an age to find them as they had over 60 parcels.  Looks like the bone idle DPD driver isn't even bothering to try to deliver to anyone, just taking it all to the delivery centre.  Just not good enough.

Royal Mail have submitted the same photo for 2 delivery reference numbers. I have Ring doorbell evidence of postman leaving my property with parcel. And yet your team advised me to call police and get an incident number before they could investigate!! Which I did. Your team now have all of the evidence they need.

This time I ordered over the phone because I couldn't get the website to select next day delivery.The lady I spoke to assured me she would get it delivered on the 9th Dec.  In spite of my reservations due to the impending mail strike , she said it would come then.  I was happy even if it came on the 10th so long as I had it for the weekend , otherwise I would have gone into town & got it at the shop.Unfortunately it didn't come.I rang on the 12th & after a long conversation, the assistant offered to send a voucher to buy some chocolate as compensation & confirmed that the packages would come on the next day....which it did, however no sign of the offered voucher.Overall am fairly happy since I got the gifts but not great service or communications, perhaps not a good idea to use Royal Mail during a dispute .\", 'Date': '08 December 2022', 'Reply': 'We are terribly sorry to hear this Kim.

Worried I would pay twice I saw a button that said place order clicked on this and I went back to the beginning of the ordering process. Started the whole process again entered all the details but this time the discount code was rejected. Called customer services the lady started to place my order and then I was cut off. Went back to the internet placed the order minus the discount. Carefully entered the recipient's address so the chocolates would be delivered direct. Now I have received an email to say the chocolates are on their way to me at my home address! What went wrong? now I will have to spend more money sending them on and it is highly unlikely they will arrive in time for Xmas. So disappointed.So called customer services this morning, no record of the recipients address I had painstakingly entered, and yes the chocolates are on the way to me!

The situation has unfolded as below: - On Black Friday weekend I initially ordered on the website - the payment did not go through. - On 28th Nov, I called up to order and pay over the telephone.- Checking my confirmation email, I noticed a mistake, the wrong items had gone through. I called back, corrected it, paid the difference.- Again, checking my new confirmation, I noticed another mistake - I called back again to correct the colour that had been ordered. - It gets to 7th December, I've received no comms about tracking, delivery. I call up - one payment didn't go through so they cancelled the order altogether, didn't email or call to let me know or try to take the payment again. Meanwhile, £101.34 HAS left my account, as confirmed by Virgin Mastercard. It is not pending. - I have sent various forms of evidence via the help@ and review@ email, the company is refusing to refund me the £101.34, I call the company frequently to find out what progress has been made - and they keep asking for another 48 hours, they say they cannot transfer me to the correct department, and the correct department have lazily not investigated the funds whatsoever - otherwise I'd have a refund on its way. I now have no Christmas gift for my husband, I'm £101.34 out of pocket, wasting time every day emailing and calling the unhelpful staff at Hotel Chocolat and having to file a dispute through Virgin Atlantic Mastercard which can take up to 120 days to process. Complete waste of my time. I initially wanted to re-order the items - but I'll pass. I can't think of a bigger headache than re-engaging with this dreadful company.

(Unlike last time where the boxes were left on my doorstep in the sunshine, which meant a number of my hot chocolate sachets had melted! Thus I had to re grate them myself!)My other issue is that I don’t have a Hotel Chocolat near to where I live. It would be at least an hours drive, so I tend to buy a few boxes of sachets all at once. Unfortunately the best before dates are very close to expiring leaving me not very long to drink them. This time they expire in January which is only a few weeks away! On a positive note the hot chocolate and velvetiser are delicious and definitely worth the money.', 'Date': '09 December 2022', 'Reply': 'Hi Emma. Thank you for your review.

No reply, so I emailed again later in the day (still no reply). I then received two invoices, with nothing about delivery on them and then two emails; one stating an item has been substituted and another to say you’ve changed your mind! Yet still no reply about delivery.The order status on your website is very poor and no help at all. Until today, it just stated “We’ve got your order”, today it has changed to “We are picking your order”.I ordered from you due to your guarantee of next day delivery as these chocolates were purchased for one of our customers in the USA, and would have been shipped onto them tomorrow.Please confirm that order 70973570 has been cancelled.Update: 3 hours after posting the above I’ve received an automated email telling me my order has been shipped.

I was at home when the delivery was claimed to be made but the parcel was not delivered to my home. After spending a long time on the phone with DPD Customer service they located the street where the delivery had been made and after comparing the photo to the front doors of many neighbouring properties I was eventually able to retreive it some hours later from another property. The property owner assumed I had been left a card by the driver to inform me that the parcel had been delivered to him (which is what should have happened) but the driver didn't speak to him and simply took a photo of his feet in the door and ran off.

They keep saying I can exchange the podster in any hotel Chocolat store which is great but not great when your nearest one is 25+ miles away so making a 50+ miles away especially when prices of fuel are what they are is not happening, also I would need to pay parking. It's frustrating that the item is possibly faulty and I'm the one who has to pay out the sort this out. I'm actually so disappointed with hotel Chocolat. It's even more frustrating when I have spent alot of money with them and had even more issues.Update. So after emailing them a good 21 times over the course of several days, I am still no closer to getting thia resolved. They take a whole 24 plus hours to reply to the email or Facebook message and when they do, they just tell you the same thing they emailed a few days ago.

Against my  better judgment, I popped by this branch where the two staff members double up as rude fighters. They had a full blown argument with me, thereby adding insult to injury, after waiting a full minute only to be told they were closed. Apparently, my daring to say I could have been informed instead of being made to wait earned me the title of one that was being rude instead of the other way round. With one worker blindly siding with her colleague and amazing me further with their fighter spirits. Obviously taking out  their issues on me. Coffee shops are not monopolies and as I receive better treatment in a highly regarded outfit just 12 minutes later, it still beats my mind how you unleash  such entities on the general public. Disgust is a mild word. To think you gave me a so-called VIP card. I cannot believe I ever gave you my custom in the past. Last day today with absolute pleasure. Shame on your Islington branch.Update: Despite taking the trouble to send an email as per the response from Hotel Chocolat, even though my review was detailed enough, my email has not even been acknowledged in nearly a fortnight.

I can’t possibly carry them all so would have to make two trips. Apparently it also asks me to ring and confirm my details in order that the chocolates that I originally ordered be delivered.

The Podster does only make espresso cups, however, you are then able to make the perfect latte however you desire after. When your espresso is done, add it to your mug. Then, pour in as much warm milk (dairy or plant-based) as you desire. You can even drink it straight, without any milk, if you’re a fan of a strong black brew. Give it a quick stir and there you have it — one flavoursome and refreshing latte coffee.

The delivery to my local shop was very quick (though why this company has to charge for click and collect I do not understand .. everywhere else this is the free option) which is good. However when I opened the box I found that the heaviest item (a bottle) was on top of the soft package items, two of which were slightly squashed. Furthermore, although there was a “fragile” label on the box, it was obvious from where my name was written on the outside that it had been turned upside down when this was done! I’m sure the contents of the slightly battered boxes will be delicious but these products are not cheap and when you’re giving a gift you want things to look perfect.', 'Date': '25 November 2022', 'Reply': 'Hi Rosemary.

We've thought long and hard about how to make Hotel Chocolat products more widely available to both new and existing customers; and Morrisons is one of our carefully selected business partners. We believe that this makes Hotel Chocolat much more accessible and reaches a larger number of customers that may not traditionally shop in one of our own locations. As such we cannot influence or control the price that you may see products advertised for sale elsewhere. However, the price they then sell Hotel Chocolat products for, and any delivery charge they make is determined by their own business metrics together with competition laws that we have no control over.

All of our products are made in small batches and with the highest quality of ingredients to maintain excellent quality. We never include the use of preservatives to extend the shelf life and advise that products will vary between a 1-8 months BBE.

The design and packaging are very nice. The ordering system was not so good. I had a booklet with discount offerings of 20% for orders over £80, but on the web version, I only have it for orders over £85. And I can only use it once it says. There were some confusion whether it is one order or more if they were delivered to different addresses.One combination allowed me to pick up at the nearest store, but not another. It was all over the place.Using Royal Mail as the delivery conduit was a bad idea. Out of 4 deliveries, only one was delivered on time and as stated in the text messages that RM sent to me. 2 of them claim to have been attempted to deliver on day 1, but the recipients didn’t receive any “sorry, whilst you were out” cards. I’m a bit dubious if they even went to the address. Eventually two were delivered the next day. Of which one was just left outside the front door. That’s a bit poor show. Didn’t even ring the doorbell. The recipient was in the house when I was on the phone with them - when I got the confirmation of delivery and she went out to look.The last package is the most expensive one as the corporate gift is still not delivered after 2 days since they sent the message to say, “it’s on its way.”', 'Date': '18 November 2022', 'Reply': 'We are terribly sorry to hear of your difficulties with our website as well as the delivery of your gifts Dennis.

I do not like to give negative reviews because I do not want to put people off purchasing from Hotel Chocolate but I would be happy to discuss with Hotel Chocolate with a view to helping them make improvements. (My order number is 70806515)On the first page I did not know whether my name or the name of the person to whom I wanted to sent the chocolates was required. Of course, I chose the wrong name - I should have chosen the addressee but I chose the name of the credit card holder.I was able to add a second address and selected that at a later stage.Later in the process, I chose to pay by debit card. Despite entering the details very carefully, it was rejected. I tried again but was rejected again.Next I tried to pay by Paypal. Again, I tried twice unsuccessfully so decided to return to the Hotel Chocolat and start again.So, I added the same gift to my bag only to find that it had retained the details from the first attempt. It was a simple job to reduce the number of items from 2 to 1 and the adressee details had been retained so I only had to add my message and select Paypal. This time payment went smoothly.I would just like to add that I make online purchases every 2 or 3 days and have been working with PCs since the early nineties so I do not regard myself as a novice.

This company excuse themselves by saying they use fresh products and that is why they have short expiry dates. Wonder why then the other box had an expiry date of March 2023? No other chocolate manufacturer would sell a bar of chocolate, which expires one months later, so how do this company get away with it? Also, upon visiting one of their stores, such as Bluewater, the expiry date is much longer. Seems to me like they are sending items which are very close to their sell by date from the warehouse in order to use their stock up. Absolutely disgusting.

I did manage to place two separate orders over £80 to be collected from Crawley in order to take advantage of the Christmas discount offered which expired at midnight 13/11. Therefore I only just made it to the deadline with a few minutes spare. Given the fact that I am a conversant user of placing orders on company websites, somebody needs to revisit the website and to improve the following features: 1) it’s very user unfriendly! I tried to find the champagne truffles tin but only saw it accidentally then when I try to find it again, I couldn’t even I ran through the different categories. At the last minute i realised it’s probably best to just look at all chocolates products. 2) The application of discount code was so obscure, I had to look several time, going back and forth, up and down the website pages then I realised it’s printed in ‘greyed out’ texts which are not prominent at all! 3) whilst it’s fine to have prominent texts to tell me that there were delivery options but when I clicked on the drop down menu, I wasn’t able to click on the ‘click and collect’ option which has a green tick sign or to deselect the other options. Logically I should be able to click, say ‘click and collect’ icon and be able to lead to a drop down menu to select the location. BUT NO,NO, NO, it’s too easy for the customers. Let’s make the work harder in another word, “let’s frustrate them.” This was what had happened, after trying and keep trying to click click to activate the ‘click and collect’ icon and scratching my head,  nothing happened, I almost gave up proceeding with my orders. Whilst I was on the brink of coming out of the website, I thought I would proceed to the next page and see whether it’s going to appear somewhere before payment, if it didn’t obviously I would still be able to stop before confirming payment. Once I navigate to the next page then I realised the delivery option and location appeared on the following page but the not previous page! BUT Why? It’s so illogical. Once the options have been displayed on the previous page, individual option should be able to be activated by touch in that page which then should take me to the option to select my preferred pick up location. 3) The delivery charges should not be applied automatically but to offer a selection of delivery options and the associated charges first. The selection should be available on the same page when delivery options were  shown. See point 2 above. I think I am particularly disappointed because I listened to an interview of one of the co-founder on resido 4 just last week and was rather impressed with the background of the inception of the brand by spotting a window in the market for an appetite for chocolates of high quality, luxury and focus is placed on the tastes of UK as opposed to that of European. It’s also interesting to know how the products were tested and also the decision to open physical stores rather than just sold online. I would be grateful if you would let me know, whether my feedback points have been agreed and acted on or not because in addition to a lot of time consumed in placing my orders, I was determined to send you this feedback immediately despite it is also taking a lot of time to try to articulate what I wanted to expressing myself in writing and which I hope I am successful in my attempt!

I explained that as this was a Christmas gift I didn’t appreciate having to explain this BBE date to the recipient.

Rest assured, the date printed is for the very end of the month and even after knowing it is perfectly safe to eat; of course at your own discretion.

The store, despite having 8 of what I ordered on the shelves, said I wasn't allowed one! I had to wait the 5 or so days for the delivery.THIS IS PATHETIC! Why should I have to wait 5 days for something you have on the shelves! Your stock is for you to manage! Furthermore, I don't see why I should have to cancel my initial online transaction, to enable a separate purchase?This is an example of ridiculous, obstructive, over-administration.

Having bought this for a Xmas gift along with the Velvetiser using there Xmas discount code, I have found this again very disappointing. Now don’t get me wrong there customer service when notified is usually outstanding, however instead of having to go down this road, send out your products first time round with minimum 3 months BBE dates. Just a heads up please check all dates when they arrive.Edit response to Hotel Chocolat advise.If you don’t think customers should shop 8 weeks before Christmas I suggest you don’t offer a Xmas discount code that far away from Xmas. I would naturally assume if you are offering £20 off of your Velvitiser most customers would also purchase the Chocolate Box’s, telling me to buy closer to Xmas is not a satisfactory response. I would think most customers would at least expect 3 month BBE date even if buying for yourself and not as  a gift. Disappointing that you put that back on the buyer.', 'Date': '29 October 2022', 'Reply': 'Hi there. Thank you for your review.

Received my order, which is a Christmas present. Best before dates are not good. Ordered the Velvetiser and then a few selections of the drinking chocolate. 3 boxes in total so 30 sachets. Also wanted to treat them to the dunking biscuits ( 3 boxes in total ) as these are lovely but again the dates on these are Best before 7th Jan !! Emailed straight away being told that their dates vary from 1 month to 8. I would have been happy with 5 months. It was a large order so you would think who ever picked the order would make sure the dates are better. My options in the reply are to return the unwanted items for refund or replacement ( not good since Royal Mail are going on 3 day strikes in November) or return to a store. All hassle that I did not expect. However, we will be returning them to a store. Probably the last time I order from Hotel Chocolate too.

I ordered through click and collect £60 worth of items and when I got to the shop I was told that I had sent my order to the wrong shop and they didn't have it.i reviewed my email to see I was in the wrong shop and asked them to look again. They came back with thw same answer, I then showed her the receipt and explained I hqd travelled to the store especially ro pick up these items. I was asked to wait, after waiting ten mins the assistant came out with my order that was in the back. I came straight home and after opening my package two of my items had broken glasses in them. I straight away took pictures and got in touch via email. They responded back quickly to say the pictures weren't good enough and that I needed to remove the broken glass out of thw boxes to prove it although you could see in the picture that the stem off the glass were at different side to the top of the glass. I explained I was trying to avoid removing the glass as I didn't want any dropping as I have dogs in the house to which they responded my products wouldn't be replaced without further evidence. I spoke to someone on the phone at customer service to ask if it was nessassary as you can see its damaged in the picture and she responded saying customer service have no access to any emails so can't help me. How can customer service have no access to customer queries to help them? So I did was asked and took the products out of the packaging and took further pictures of each product and sending a total of 9 pictures. I have no received an email that I have proved one product is broken but I have sent several pictures of each and if I want both products replacing they need even more pictures. I have tried ringing the customer service desk which is open till 8pm Monday to Friday to be told at 6.50pm they see closed!! I spend over a £100 with you and after picking this order up spend a further £50 in the shop. This is a lot of money to spend on chocolate gifts but I have always loved your products. You are meant to be a premium brand but your customer service has been horrible and in times where money is so strapped for someone to be spending this amount of money you should be giving amazing service as premium provider. I was so excited to get these gifts for my family but they aren't in any condition to give to anyone and I'm having to fight you to have the product replaced. I don't even want a refund just a replacement. Shocking service and I'm very disappointed.\", 'Date': '24 October 2022', 'Reply': 'Hi Danielle, we are so sorry to hear of your experience and we really would like to look into this for you to see what we can do to help.

No guesses for what happened then - another text to say they had delivered at 9.37am.  As they always leave the parcel outside without knocking, they didn't wait to check we were there, which of course we weren't.

I’ve only eaten 3 & won’t be tempted by any more nor will I offer them out to others.

I was at home but heard no ring of the doorbell, I got a message on my phone to say my item had been delivered, there was a photo with it. No message through the door from RM to say where it was left. The weather was raining hard so by the time i had a break from working and realised the package had been left outside on the front drive the box was soaking wet and starting to collapse. It’s lucky Hotel Chocolat have good sturdy packaging, otherwise the calendars would hade been ruined and I would have had to ask for replacements.

The quality of the chocolates are excellent. However with the cafe late sachets, I have been disappointed a second time by the short best before date which is unreasonably short. The two boxes of 10 which I received today have an expiry date of November which is less than two months. This is short for such a coffee product. 6 months would be reasonable, but at least until Christmas and New Year when I expect guests. I only drink these at weekends perhaps once or twice a week and the date of most will be beyond the best before date.

We're so sorry to hear that the BBE date on your recent order is shorter than expected. All of Hotel Chocolat’s recipes use only the finest and freshest ingredients and never add any artificial preservatives to extend the shelf life. Due to this, many of our products do naturally carry a shorter BBE date but we always make sure that our products have a minimum of one month before their Best Before Date, giving you plenty of time to savour them. Please also note that the BBE means this selection is best enjoyed before the end of October to ensure the utmost quality and flavour of the product. However, this is not a use by date so you may still safely enjoy the chocolates after this date should you wish/feel comfortable doing so. Of course, with that being said, we always want our customers to be 100% happy and completely understand your desire for a longer shelf life.

However if I could now change my review to ZERO stars I would!!  I received a velvetiser as a gift in December 2020 and was extremely pleased with it at the time and the quality of hot chocolates available. The velvetiser has been used a maximum of 10 times and has been cleaned following the instructions on the website. It hasn’t been used a lot at all and if anything it’s just pretty to look at. It’s extremely well looked after. A hot chocolate is a once in a while treat during the colder months. The velvetiser has started to RUST around the mouth having only used it 10 times!!!! I’ve sent photos as evidence. Customer services have been an absolute shambles as they are only interested in offering 50% off another velvetiser which will happen again and so on and so on. Plus this was a gift and I’m not spending £50.00 on another one. It’s not happening. I’m extremely disappointed as this is supposed to be a luxury product and it has an expensive price tag. The velvetiser is more of a for show product I believe and isn’t something you can make use of. For something which has had a maximum of 10 uses you would not expect to see this. Customer services believe this is an generous offer! I do not, I feel it’s an insult from a loyal customer who has continued to purchase from this company and who has done nothing but say positive things about this company to family/friends but this has changed my opinion. My advice would be to avoid at all costs if you are thinking of purchasing one and from this company.29th September 2022 - FURTHER to the response below from Hotel Chocolat I’ve emailed the email address to be OFFERED THE SAME OFFER AGAIN!!!!

So I love Hotel Chocolat and have purchased products from them over many years however…… I recently found out my friend had a Velvetiser and she was telling me how much she loved it. A few weeks later I received an email from Hotel Chocolat and they were offering a great deal if you purchased some of the hot chocolate sachets to be used with the Velvetiser.  Amazing I thought…  time to start my Xmas shopping I thought…. Won’t my friend be happy I thought…… sadly no! My order arrived today - it is the 22 September and one box is BBE 10/22 the other 11/22. Now I know that chocolate doesn’t always have a long shelf life but 5 weeks remaining is ridiculous - was the only reason they had an offer on was to get rid of short dated stock!?!? Either way I am left with hot chocolate pouches that won’t be used and are heading for the bin and I now have to rethink my friend’s Xmas present - not impressed I will think twice about purchasing online and taking advantage of offers as I am now out of pocket so not a great deal after all.', 'Date': '22 September 2022', 'Reply': \"Hi Anna, I'm really sorry to hear about this.

My order was quickly delivered to store. However, every box I have been sent has an BBE / expiry date of 10/22. It appears this 2 for 1 sale (supposedly to celebrate the ‘return of hot chocolate season’) has just been a guise for Hotel Chocolat to shift old stock. I find this so underhand of a brand I have always thought highly of.I regularly buy the hot chocolate sachets and thought this was a good offer. I feel quite cheated. I have never bought a box with such a short BBE date. I have seen in-store that products with nearing BBE dates are sold off at a reduced rate (and this is always clearly stated, which is not that case with this 2 for 1 online sale).Edit: No one from Hotel Chocolat ever got in contact with me - and they are now selling salted caramel hot chocolate sachets with a shelf life of 12 months.', 'Date': '16 September 2022', 'Reply': 'Hi Gee.

So I'm am now £115 out of pocket and still don't have what I ordered. If they have nothing in place if this kind of thing happens and just tell people we will let you know in a few days that is juts crap customer care they have no interest now they have my money.

Something to keep in mind if you are ordering in advance or for a special occasion. You could put the best before date on the website, as do many of the online supermarkets. The \"cabinet\" containing the chocolates was dented, presumably in transit, but this makes it look a little secondhand especially as it was intended as a gift.

Another text on Saturday afternoon saying unable to deliver (duh - what happened to my instructions to courier?)  Finally delivered on Monday 5th during office hours.  It would have been prudent for HC to have waited until Monday to despatch rather than risk leaving chocs shunting about in hot vans/depots for that many days in these temperatures.

As I was packing the unit to return today I phoned to see if the new unit had been posted.  I must have misunderstood as they will not post a new one until old one had been received.

I came in with my dad to the store and got some chocolate and an ice cream, I was served by one of the nicest, sweetest, helpful young women I have ever met called Subhana (apologies if I have spelt that wrong). She was so knowledgeable about the products she was selling but what struck me was how happy and cheerful she was, she did the best sundae my dad \"has ever had\" he was absolutely made up so we had to take a photo lol. It makes such a lovely change to see young people at work who are actually bothered about doing their jobs and she really did go out of her way to help us which was so nice of her.

When ordering I did specify delivery on 22nd when I knew I would be at home. Two issues really. 1) why allow a customer to select a delivery date on your ordering page if it is ignored by the carrier 2) when the carrier did not have the door answered why did they not try to deliver to a neighbour or leave a card and I would havecollecred at the RM depot?', 'Date': '19 August 2022', 'Reply': 'Hi Stephen, thank you so much for your review.

All of Hotel Chocolat’s recipes use only the finest and freshest ingredients and never add any artificial preservatives to extend the shelf life. Due to this, many of our products do naturally carry a shorter BBE date, typically between 1 – 8 months. However you can be sure they are very safe to eat right up to the end of that BBE month, without any deterioration in the taste, quality or texture. With that being said, we do always want our customers to be 100% happy and would love to restore your faith in Hotel Chocolat!

The subscription itself is good. You can change flavours at any time easily on the website via your account.However the hot chocolate I have received in the last four to five deliveries have had extremely short best before dates on them, of only 3/4months, considering it’s the middle of the summer (for me not the time of year I indulge in a lot of hot choc!)! The delivery I received today (August) had November 2022 as best before date, yet the delivery I received beginning of July had a December best before date. I’m not sore what the date range is in store, but for me this is too short and if I could cancel the 12 month subscription and buy as and when I needed it, on this basis then I would, as I have ended up giving alot of boxes away so they don’t go to waste', 'Date': '03 August 2022', 'Reply': \"We're sorry for any disappointment Maria.

This time I added 3 Selector packs (3 for £12), & a box, when the order was calculated no discount had been deducted. On phoning HC I was told this discount did not apply as was getting free delivery, but if I rang after my delivery they could make a refund.  That was kind but for £1.50 I probably won’t bother, and know not to order Selectors again. Delivery was next which was very prompt, but, the parcel was dispatched on Tues 2nd Aug (27 deg) arriving 09.00 on Wed (24deg) to me personally, the Postie was unaware of the fragility of its contents.Packed beautifully as always, but i could feel the warmth as I opened the box nothing was actually melted, & I have placed them in the coolest room in the house & hope they will be ok. I do appreciate Chocolate has to be treated carefully re. its temperature, so maybe consideration to some form of insulated packaging will be needed as the world becomes a warmer place.Thank goodness they were at least delivered so early in the morning and not my usual 15.00 delivery time!', 'Date': '03 August 2022', 'Reply': 'Hi Jill.

Rather than increase the cost to you for your subscription, we have instead reviewed the products included and you may now see a change to the number and types of items included in each delivery. Your feedback is incredibly important to us and your comments have been passed over to the relevant department.

That said, I have recently ordered with a discount code, as they haven't had a good selection of sale items for months. I didn't find it to be very good value for money, particularly as the postage for 500g worth of stuff (which would cost less than £3) is charged at £4.95. I don't think this is a good system, as people buying small things are getting totally ripped off - it needs to be charged by weight, not by amount of items.

When I bought the Velvetiser in March I ordered 5 large bags of chocolate in different flavours, I've already had to throw 2 unused bags away because they were out of date within 1 month and 2 months of receiving them, I've got another 2 large bags that only go to November, 1 large bag that only goes until August and out of the 5 boxes I have just received to try different flavours and the Latte choices only 1 of those goes until January next year the rest are August, September and November. I am very disappointed at spending so much money, plus P & P each time to then have to throw them out, I can't live on hot chocolate several times a day to use them up in date. I would have thought they should be dated longer than they so far have been.

My daughter received the order today (8th June) but was disappointed to note that the best before date is the end of next month on all 6 pouches. Although I am sure the hot chocolate will still be fine after that date, I would not have bought that quantity in store with such a limited shelf life, had an in store purchase been an option.

When are we going to be able to buy Lemon/Lime/Blackcurrant/Sour Cherry etc in the full-size Selector format?2) I always buy multiples of the same 6-7 favourite Selectors (then make them up into my own selection box of pure heaven at home). I am fed up of making the pilgrimage to the nearest H/Choc store, only to find that on 4 out of 5 trips at least ONE of my favourites is out of stock (sometimes two). This has invariably been the case since before Covid, so they cannot use that as an excuse and need to get their act together on this, as otherwise it\\'s truly infuriating for customers who know what they want, & trips to store feel like playing Russian Roulette.3) So if like me you then trek back home to order online instead, you have to pay £5 for the privilege of finding that usually the missing items ARE available on there. But that the £5 (regardless of how much you order) is only for a 5-7 WORKING days service. So depending on which day of the week you order, it could be an actual ten day wait for the chocs. When you had started off by going to all the trouble of obtaining chocs today - not by the end of next week.

You decide.', 'Review': \"I visited the Woking store on June 4th with my granddaughter. It's a lovely looking store, well-stocked and clean. The store assistant looked at me and I did notice her looking me up and down on entering but I ignored it. My granddaughter and I looked at the hot chocolate machines when I heard another customer come in.  The assistant  greeted  this customer with not only hello, but how can I help you. She engaged with him until he finished his purchase and went on his way. He was white  She also interacted with the two white ladies who were in the store, they had a good conversation and I would agree a pleasant service.  She was very friendly. I waited for roughly 15 mins and not once did she ask me if I needed help. I would also like to add that when my husband came in, she did acknowledge him with a smile and was about to approach him but he diverted to me to hand me a receipt before leaving to collect an item at another store.  My husband is white. I decided to leave, but before leaving I asked the young lady if she thought that my custom was not as important as the white gentleman she served first or the two white ladies. I told her that every customer that walks through the door deserves not to be pre judged by the colour of their skin or how they may be dressed. I am really disappointed as I have bought chocolates from other stores and was pleased to see one in Woking as most of my chocolates for my business come from Lindt online.I made a complaint to the customer service and apparently the video evidence says something else! “Due to the seriousness of the allegation, we launched an investigation into your complaint and have reviewed the CCTV footage from the date and time of your visit. We were able to locate the incident based on your description of the events that took place.““We could also see that you left the store after around 5 minutes inside, during which time the store assistant was occupied for the entire duration up until you questioned her.“Totally inaccurate!As for leaving the store, 5 mins is definitely wrong.  The assistant spoke and served the male customer and also offered him a membership, where he had to give his details.  That alone took time. The two ladies that had a conversation was at least 5 mins alone! If they really look at the footage properly, they would of seen my husband giving me a receipt.  This was to collect bakery goods next door, that would be ready in 15 minutes. The the footage would also show me sending my granddaughter out of the store  TWICE!  This was to check on our order next door.They said the assistant was preoccupied?  She was standing at the counter.  She WAS NOT SERVING ANYONE!  We were the only ones in the store when the other customers had gone.I find it absolutely disgusting that in this day and age something so serious can be swept under the carpet because that's exactly what happened I'm glad to say I've never experienced this kind of service in the other stores.Disappointed is an understatement but I will call it out for what it is.Plain prejudice Hotel Chocolate did not respond to my following email.\", 'Date': '08 June 2022', 'Reply': None}, {'Name': 'Lisa', 'N_Reviews': '4 reviews', 'Ratingss': '5', 'Title': 'Christmas chocolates', 'Review': 'I purchased some items for Christmas presents.

Unfortunately the outstanding amount accumulates and you end up with a cupboard of unused sachets.I thought being able to pause the subscription for a month or two would be possible, but no that’s not possible. Rather than just stopping the delivery, you need to take delivery and then return them for a refund. What a waste of time (for Hotel Chocolat, myself, delivery companies etc).

Although I believe the US side of customer service needs some streamlining so I don't have to start over explaining the issue and what was tried with new representatives in the ticket thread.I loved the velvetiser and used it sporadically during the cold months as a special treat. We recently had a cold spell and I decided to make myself a cup of hot chocolate using milk and hotel chocolat hot chocolate. The machine made a horrible grinding noise. I dumped the hot chocolate and put in soap and water to clean and it makes the same sound. Through visual inspection there is nothing stuck at all and the sound came fr the inside of the machine. Since this is not an old machine I contacted the company, which is difficult to do as you have to have an account and make a ticket. I received a speedy, but useless response saying to make sure it is clean and only use hotel chocolat with it and to contact them if I require any further help. So I had to make another ticket as you can't respond to the email directly to reiterate that it was clean as it made that horrible sound even with soap and water per the cleaning instructions and I only use their hot chocolate. I have never received a response to this so I see they do not stand by their product and will not offer product support if you have any problem. This was not even used heavily and is little more than a year old.\", 'Date': '13 May 2022', 'Reply': \"We're so sorry to hear this has happened, and for the disappointment, this certainly doesn't sound right.

I hastily made it to the comments thread and found out that you still have eggs for sale! I felt obliged to go for it!

I am such an impatient foodie that I couldn't wait so paid a small amount for next day delivery and suffice to say I've already received them. (Even though only ordered yesterday.) I am not a patient person so had to break into both of them and taste all four chocolate thick shells and have some of the choccies from both! What an exquisite treat.
